```

## Quick Start

To start using the Amplitude MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. Make sure Claude Desktop is installed on your machine (download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download))

2. Create or edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the Amplitude MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amplitude-analytics": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "amplitude-mcp-server",
        "--api-key",
        "YOUR_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and start tracking analytics!

## Detailed Usage

### With Claude Desktop

After setting up the configuration file as shown in the Quick Start section, you can use the Amplitude analytics capabilities directly in your conversations with Claude.

Examples of prompts you can use:

- "Track a custom event in Amplitude named 'document_generated' for user 'user123'"
- "Track a page view for the pricing page in Amplitude"
- "Create a new user profile in Amplitude for John Doe with email john@example.com"
- "Update user profile information in Amplitude for user 'user123'"
- "Track a purchase of Product X for $49.99"

Claude will use the appropriate Amplitude MCP tool based on your request.

### With Other MCP Clients

This server uses the standard Model Context Protocol and can be integrated with any MCP client:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npx amplitude-mcp-server --api-key YOUR_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY
   ```

2. Connect your MCP client to the server using stdio transport

3. The client can discover and use the available tools (track_event, track_pageview, track_signup, set_user_properties, track_revenue)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not starting:**
   - Ensure you've provided a valid Amplitude API key
   - Check that Node.js is installed and is version 16 or higher

2. **Claude Desktop not showing Amplitude tools:**
   - Verify your claude_desktop_config.json file syntax
   - Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after editing the config
   - Check that the path to the server is correct

3. **Events not appearing in Amplitude:**
   - Verify your Amplitude API key is correct
   - Check your Amplitude project settings to ensure data is being received
   - Events may take a few minutes to appear in the Amplitude interface

### Debug Mode

To run the server in debug mode for more verbose logging:

```bash
npx amplitude-mcp-server --api-key YOUR_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY --debug
```

## Security Notes

- Your Amplitude API key is stored in the Claude Desktop configuration file. Ensure this file has appropriate permissions
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive tokens in production environments
- This server does not implement rate limiting - consider adding additional security measures for production use
- Events are sent directly to Amplitude's API - review Amplitude's privacy policy for data handling practices
