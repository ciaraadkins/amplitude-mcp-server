```

### Tracking Conversion Funnel

You can track a user's journey through a conversion funnel:

```
You: I want to track a user's journey through our funnel. Start by tracking a page view for the landing page for user "prospect_123".

Claude: Tracked the page view for the landing page.

You: Now track that they viewed the product page.

Claude: Tracked the page view for the product page.

You: They added an item to their cart. Track that event.

Claude: Tracked the "add_to_cart" event.

You: Finally, they completed checkout with order ID 12345 and spent $129.99. Track that conversion.

Claude: Tracked the "purchase_completed" event with the order_id property set to 12345 and revenue of $129.99.
```

## Programmatic Usage (for Developers)

If you're building your own MCP client, you can call the Amplitude MCP server tools programmatically:

```javascript
// Example using the MCP client SDK
const client = new McpClient(/* your configuration */);
await client.initialize();

// Track an event
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "track_event",
  arguments: {
    event_name: "button_clicked",
    user_id: "user123",
    properties: {
      button_id: "signup",
      page: "homepage"
    }
  }
});

console.log(result);
```

## Tips for Best Practices with Amplitude

1. **Use Consistent User IDs**: When possible, use the same `user_id` across events to build a coherent user journey.

2. **Add Context to Events**: Include relevant properties with each event to make your analytics more useful.

3. **Track Meaningful Events**: Focus on tracking events that provide actionable insights rather than tracking everything.

4. **Use Event Naming Conventions**: Follow a consistent naming convention for your events, such as `object_action` (e.g., "button_clicked", "form_submitted").

5. **Set User Properties Early**: Set important user properties when users first sign up to ensure comprehensive user data.

6. **Track Revenue Accurately**: When tracking purchases, ensure you set the correct price, quantity, and revenue_type for accurate revenue metrics.

7. **Follow Privacy Best Practices**: Always comply with privacy regulations and only track data you have permission to collect.

8. **Check Amplitude Dashboard**: Regularly check your Amplitude dashboard to ensure events are being tracked correctly.

## Usage with Business Intelligence

You can use the Amplitude MCP server to gain valuable business insights:

```
You: Can you track a feature usage event in Amplitude for user "customer_abc" who just used our new AI assistant feature?

Claude: I'll track that for you.

[Claude uses the Amplitude track_event tool]

Claude: I've tracked the "feature_used" event with the feature property set to "ai_assistant" for user "customer_abc".
```

## Integration with User Onboarding

Track key onboarding steps to analyze user activation:

```
You: Let's track onboarding progress for a new user. First, track that user "new_user_456" completed the account creation step.

Claude: Tracked the "onboarding_step_completed" event with step="account_creation".

You: Now track that they've completed the profile setup step.

Claude: Tracked the "onboarding_step_completed" event with step="profile_setup".

You: Finally, track that they've completed the tutorial.

Claude: Tracked the "onboarding_step_completed" event with step="tutorial_completed".
```

These examples should help you understand how to effectively use the Amplitude MCP server to track analytics events with Claude or other MCP clients.
